# Sound Files

This directory should contain the following sound files:

- `spin.mp3` - Sound played when spinning the reels
- `win.mp3` - Sound played upon winning
- `lose.mp3` - Sound played upon losing
- `near_miss.mp3` - Sound played for near misses

The application has fallback empty sound files if these are not present, but for the best experience, add actual sound files here.
